Test Name----\> Testing for IMAP SMTP Injection

Objectives---\> \- Identify IMAP/SMTP injection points.

\- Understand the data flow and deployment structure of the system.

\- Assess the injection impacts.

**Overview-**

IMAP/SMTP Injection is a lesser-known yet potent vulnerability that occurs when unsanitized user input is injected into email protocols such as IMAP (Internet Message Access Protocol) or SMTP (Simple Mail Transfer Protocol). These protocols, while traditionally used for fetching and sending emails, can become attack surfaces when user input is directly inserted into protocol commands.

Applications that automate email communication—like contact forms, password resets, and support ticket systems—often interact with SMTP servers. If user-supplied data is embedded in email headers or commands without validation, attackers can inject additional protocol commands. This could lead to unauthorized email sending (spam relay), header spoofing, data leaks, or in some extreme cases, even command execution on vulnerable mail servers.

In IMAP, the risk involves manipulating the commands used to access mailboxes, potentially granting access to other users' emails or triggering unexpected behavior in email clients or webmail interfaces.

**Real World Example-**

**The Incident:**  
A customer support portal allowed users to submit feedback, which was emailed to the support team using SMTP. The form accepted Name, Email, and Message fields. These were concatenated into an email like:

From: user@example.com    
To: support@company.com    
Subject: New Feedback    
Name: *$*{user\_name}    
Message: *$*{user\_message}  
An attacker input the following in the Name field:

Attacker\\*r\\nBcc: victim@rivalcompany.com*  
The resulting email became:

From: user@example.com    
To: support@company.com    
Subject: New Feedback    
Name: Attacker    
Bcc: victim@rivalcompany.com    
Message: \[attacker's message\]  
**What Went Wrong:**

* The application failed to sanitize CRLF (\\r\\n) sequences in user input.

* The attacker injected new headers using carriage return \+ line feed characters.

* This enabled mass email distribution, impersonation, and potential data leaks.

This form of SMTP header injection allowed the attacker to silently include others in the email thread, hijack email communications, and potentially use the server as an open mail relay.

**How the Vulnerability occurs-**

IMAP/SMTP Injection vulnerabilities generally occur due to:

* **Improper input sanitization:** Applications allow CR (\\r) and LF (\\n) characters in user inputs.

* **Direct concatenation into protocol commands or headers:** User input is embedded into SMTP/IMAP commands (e.g., RCPT TO, MAIL FROM, SELECT, FETCH).

* **Lack of command-level validation:** Applications don’t validate or restrict what commands are constructed or how they’re structured.

**Common attack vectors include:**

* Injecting additional email headers (Bcc, Cc, Reply-To) via newline characters.

* Altering email body content or inserting malicious links.

* Manipulating IMAP commands to traverse or access unintended folders.

**Impacts:**

* Email spoofing or impersonation.

* Spam relaying (using the system to send bulk emails).

* Data exfiltration via blind carbon copies.

* Breaching message integrity or confidentiality.

* Credential harvesting (e.g., sending fake password reset emails).

**Secure Coding Recommendations-**

* **Sanitize CRLF characters:** Strip or encode \\r and \\n characters from user inputs, especially those used in headers or protocol commands.

* **Use trusted email libraries:** Libraries like PHPMailer, JavaMail, or Python's email module have built-in safeguards against header injection.

* **Don’t trust user input in headers:** Never allow user-supplied data to directly populate fields like From, To, Subject, or any SMTP command without validation.

* **Enforce strict input formats:** Use regex or input constraints for fields like name, subject, or email addresses.

* **Implement least privilege:** Configure the email server to only allow authenticated and authorized email sending—never allow open relays.

* **Log and monitor email activity:** Detect anomalies such as mass sending, unknown recipients, or malformed headers.

**Mitigation Steps (Developer Focused)-**

·    **Input Validation:**

* Allow only printable ASCII characters for headers.

* Block or escape CR (\\r) and LF (\\n) characters in user-supplied fields.

* Use allowlists for expected formats (e.g., name: \[a-zA-Z\\s\]+, email: RFC-compliant regex).

  **Email Library Security:**

* Use libraries with built-in protections against header injection.

* Avoid building raw SMTP requests manually.

* Set strict boundaries on field sizes and allowed values.

  **SMTP Server Hardening:**

* Disable unauthenticated relay.

* Use rate limiting and outbound filters to detect abuse.

* Enforce TLS for mail transport.

  **IMAP Access Protections:**

* Sanitize any user input used in IMAP operations (like mailbox names).

* Apply strict role-based access controls.

* Prevent direct user control over IMAP command construction.

  **Testing and Logging:**

* Include SMTP/IMAP injection in automated test suites.

* Log rejected inputs with anomalous control characters for forensic review.

* Monitor for unexpected Bcc/Cc usage or mail spikes.
