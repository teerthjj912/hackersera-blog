Test Name----\> Testing for Weak Security Question Answer

Objectives----\> \- Determine the complexity and how straight-forward the questions are.

\- Assess possible user answers and brute force capabilities.

**Overview-**

Security questions were once the go-to backup for password recovery. But in today's threat landscape, they‚Äôre often a **glaring weak spot**. When questions are too simple ("What is your favorite color?") or answers can be easily guessed or found on social media ("Mother‚Äôs maiden name"), attackers don‚Äôt need brute force ‚Äî they just need Google or a scroll through your Facebook.

If your application still uses security questions, it's crucial to **evaluate their strength, uniqueness, and resistance to guesswork or social engineering.**

**Technologies commonly affected:**

* Legacy web portals (especially banking, government, or academic systems)

* Any system offering password recovery/reset via static questions

**Real World Example-**

**Incident:** In 2008, Sarah Palin‚Äôs Yahoo\! email account was hacked by someone who correctly guessed the answer to her security question: "Where did you meet your spouse?" ‚Äî information publicly available online.

**What went wrong:**

* The system relied on a single, easily guessable question

* No multi-factor authentication as backup

* No attempt detection or account lockout mechanisms

**How the Vulnerability occurs-**

Security question vulnerabilities typically arise when:

* The questions are **too simple or generic**  
  e.g., ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs your favorite food?‚Äù, ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs your pet‚Äôs name?‚Äù

* The answers are **guessable or publicly known**  
  (especially for public figures or oversharers)

* The answers are **stored insecurely** (e.g., in plaintext)

* The system allows **brute-force attempts** or doesn‚Äôt throttle/restrict multiple wrong guesses

* There‚Äôs **no validation** to ensure users pick unique or complex answers

**Example attack:**  
An attacker resets a user‚Äôs password using What city were you born in?. Knowing the target's public profile, they try 5-10 city names and get access ‚Äî no hacking tools required.

**Secure Coding Recommendations-**

Modern systems should **avoid relying solely on security questions**. If you must use them (e.g., for legacy compliance), treat them like passwords:

**Question & Answer Complexity**

* Avoid questions with **finite or easily guessable answers**  
  (e.g., colors, cities, relatives)  
* Let users **create their own custom question/answer pair**  
  ‚Äî but validate that the answer is sufficiently long and complex  
* Encourage **non-trivial answers**: enforce a **minimum length**, require **alphanumeric** input

**Limit Guessability**

* Block use of answers found in **common password dictionaries**  
* Monitor and alert on multiple failed recovery attempts  
* Use **CAPTCHA** or similar friction to deter automation

**Use Better Alternatives**

* Prefer **email-based or SMS-based** recovery with short-lived, single-use codes  
* Encourage use of **MFA for account recovery**  
* If using security questions, **require confirmation via second channel** (email/SMS).

**Mitigation Steps (Developer Focused)-**

**üìú Input Validation and Answer Storage**

* Enforce **minimum answer length** (e.g., ‚â• 10 characters)  
* Store answers as **salted, hashed values** ‚Äî never plaintext

import bcrypt  
hashed\_answer \= bcrypt.hashpw(user\_answer.encode(), bcrypt.gensalt())

**Throttle and Monitor Recovery Attempts**

* Limit recovery attempts per user/IP (e.g., max 3 tries/hour)  
* Trigger **alerts** for unusual recovery patterns

**MFA or Multi-Step Recovery**

* Combine security question with:  
  * Email or SMS OTP  
  * Biometric prompt (where applicable)  
  * Temporary account lock and admin intervention (for high-privilege users)

**Deprecate Security Questions Altogether**

If feasible, **disable security question recovery** entirely and shift to:

* **Magic links** sent via email  
* **Authenticator-based recovery**  
* **Time-bound tokens** with 2FA confirmation
