**WSTG-ATHN-04**

Test Name----\> Testing for Bypassing Authentication Schema

Objectives----\> \- Ensure that authentication is applied across all services that require it.

**Overview-**

Bypassing authentication means gaining unauthorized access to protected resources without valid credentials. This usually happens when **authentication checks are inconsistently applied**, misconfigured, or entirely missing in parts of the application — especially on alternate endpoints, legacy APIs, or "hidden" admin paths.

Such flaws can let attackers skip login entirely or escalate access, exposing sensitive data or functions. And let’s be real — if your login system is a turnstile, these flaws are the guy hopping over it.

**Commonly affected technologies:**

* REST and GraphQL APIs

* Admin or internal panels

* Microservices and service-to-service calls

* Single Page Applications (SPAs) with frontend route protections only

* Legacy URLs or mobile API endpoints

**Real World Example-**

**Incident:** In 2020, a fintech startup suffered a major breach when its **mobile API endpoints skipped server-side auth checks**. While the web app enforced login properly, attackers reverse-engineered the mobile app and directly accessed the APIs to pull sensitive user data — no credentials required.

**What went wrong:** Backend APIs blindly trusted requests from the mobile app, assuming the app handled authentication. There were no **server-side validations**, just frontend controls.

**How the Vulnerability occurs-**

This vulnerability typically occurs when:

* Authentication is implemented only on the **UI/frontend**, not enforced at the **backend level**.

* Legacy endpoints or "forgotten" routes skip modern auth middleware.

* Developers assume "security through obscurity" — e.g., hidden admin paths.

* Role checks are missing or loosely validated (e.g., admin=true in query).

* Public endpoints return too much data without verifying the requestor’s identity.

**Example insecure route:**

@app.route('/admin/export', *methods*\=\['GET'\])  
*def* export\_data():  
    *\# Missing: auth check*  
    return download\_sensitive\_data()

**Secure Coding Recommendations-**

To prevent authentication bypass:

* Enforce **authentication at the backend level** — every sensitive route should verify the identity of the requestor.

* Use **centralized auth middleware** to apply checks uniformly across all endpoints.

* Validate session tokens, JWTs, or API keys on every request, regardless of client type.

* Avoid using **client-side-only controls** for authentication — attackers can bypass them with tools like Postman, Burp Suite, or curl.

* Remove or secure all legacy routes and deprecated APIs.

* Protect sensitive actions with **defense-in-depth** — combine authentication \+ role-based authorization \+ logging.

**Recommended frameworks and tools:**

* Express/Node.js: passport.js for uniform auth enforcement

* Python Flask/Django: decorators like @login\_required

* Spring Boot: @PreAuthorize annotations

* API Gateways: Apply global JWT verification

**Mitigation Steps (Developer Focused)-**

**Backend-First Authentication**

* Never rely on frontend authentication alone — implement and enforce auth checks **on the server**.

* Use consistent middleware to wrap all protected endpoints.

@app.route('/user/profile')  
@login\_required  
*def* get\_profile():  
    ...  
**Secure APIs and Alternate Entry Points**

* Review **all endpoints**, including mobile, admin, debug, and internal APIs.

* Ensure **access tokens or session IDs** are required and validated for each request.

* Implement **scopes/roles** to restrict access (e.g., admin-only vs. regular user routes).

**Discovery and Logging**

* Regularly scan your application for unprotected or undocumented endpoints.

* Use tools like OWASP ZAP, Burp Suite, or custom scripts to test endpoint protections.

* Log access to sensitive routes and alert on suspicious behavior.

**Regression-Proofing**

* Create automated tests to verify authentication enforcement on all routes.

* During refactors or feature additions, test endpoints for unintentional exposure.

* Require **code reviews** to include auth check confirmation for new routes.
