**WSTG-ATHN-10**

Test Name----\> Testing for Weaker Authentication in Alternative Channel

Objectives----\> \- Identify alternative authentication channels.

\- Assess the security measures used and if any bypasses exists on the alternative channels.

**Overview-**

While a web application might have strong authentication in the main interface, **alternative access points**—like APIs, mobile apps, legacy portals, or integrations—may not have the same guard dogs on duty.

This test identifies and evaluates **alternate authentication channels** to determine whether they follow the same security posture. A single weak point—like an API accepting credentials over plain HTTP or skipping MFA—can become a backdoor for attackers.

**Technologies commonly affected:**

* REST/SOAP APIs

* Mobile frontends using token-based auth

* Legacy admin portals or third-party integrations

* Alternate environments (staging/dev)

**Real World Example-**

**Incident:** In 2019, a major financial app had strict login rules on the main website (MFA, rate limiting), but the **mobile API** allowed brute force attacks with no lockout. Attackers used the API to test password lists on thousands of accounts.

**What went wrong:**

* No consistency in authentication controls across channels

* Lack of rate limiting and monitoring on mobile endpoints

* Auth tokens could be reused without expiration

**How the Vulnerability occurs-**

These flaws occur when security teams focus only on the **primary web interface** and neglect others, allowing:

* **API endpoints** that skip login controls (e.g., no MFA, weak session management)  
* **Staging environments** with hardcoded credentials or test bypasses  
* **Mobile or thick client apps** using insecure local auth or cached tokens  
* **Third-party interfaces** that trust tokens blindly without validation

**Example:**

POST /api/v1/login HTTP/1.1  
Authorization: Basic dXNlcjpwYXNz

This mobile endpoint might accept credentials **without enforcing HTTPS**, or skip 2FA, unlike the web login.

**Secure Coding Recommendations-**

**Consistency Across Channels**

* Enforce **uniform authentication policies** across all access channels  
* All entry points (web, API, mobile) must support:  
  * Secure token exchange  
  * MFA where applicable  
  * Strong password policies  
  * Session expiry and revocation

**Token and Session Handling**

* Bind tokens to **IP, device, or session**  
* Enforce **short token lifespans** with rotation  
* Invalidate tokens on logout, password change, or suspicious activity

**Security Awareness**

* Document all application entry points, including:  
  * Partner APIs  
  * Staging/test environments  
  * Mobile/thick clients

**Mitigation Steps (Developer Focused)-**

**Standardize Authentication Logic**

* Use centralized auth modules or identity providers (e.g., OAuth2, SSO)  
* Don’t duplicate or fork auth logic across environments  
* Apply **the same validation, token issuance, and renewal flow** everywhere

**Secure API & Mobile Auth**

* Enforce HTTPS with strict TLS policies  
* Require valid, signed tokens with **audience (aud) and issuer (iss) claims**  
* Implement **rate limiting**, logging, and anomaly detection on API endpoints

*def* validate\_token(*token*):  
    if not token.is\_signed or token.aud \!= 'myapp':  
        return unauthorized()

**Disable Weak or Legacy Interfaces**

* Decommission old or unused APIs and portals  
* Block access to staging environments from the public internet  
* Monitor all exposed endpoints for unusual behavior or unrecognized traffic

**Developer Checklist**

* MFA enforced on all login paths  
* HTTPS enforced across all endpoints  
* Unified token/session logic  
* Rate limiting and lockouts applied consistently  
* Alternative channels documented and tested
